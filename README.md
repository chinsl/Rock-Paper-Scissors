# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is an implementation of Rock-Paper-Scissors game via JavaScript. 

Rock-paper-scissors is a two-player game in which opponents simultaneously declare rock, paper, or scissors. Being a zero-sum game, the result is a draw or a win and a loss. Each item of rock, paper, and scissors has an advantageous relation to the other: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. 

This is a program meant to simulate the game in the console, against the computer -- the webpage is empty. 

There will be a function that returns a randomized "selection" by the computer and a function that takes in the player's selection and the computer's selection. This function will return a string that declares the winner. 

There will be another function that calls the previous function to play a five-round game the keeps score and reports the winner or loser at the end.
